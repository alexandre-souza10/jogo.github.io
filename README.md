## Project Description:
- In this Project, a game called Pedra, Papel, Scissors was developed, a Front-End project using only HTML and images for its development.
The project has a basic stylization, but very functional, functioning correctly the game process. It is a Single Player game, where you have a Player, and an Adversary, which in this case would be the machine;
When we click on the images, with the respective hand positions for the game, everything flows correctly, and the system automatically makes a move too, and immediately points out the winner in the game.

- The Game Project, has the functionality to recreate a famous and functional game, in virtual form.
  
- Next we have a small instructional video, where we show the functionality of the project, and how the game should be played.
